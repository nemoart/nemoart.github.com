<div><b>1. What is NEMOART?</b></div><div>&nbsp;“
<b>NEMOART</b>” : <i>3D modeling + rendering + compositing </i></div><div><br></div>
<div>Today, many people share their daily lives and pictures on SNS with others. Most of those pictures are taken by their smartphones instead of real cameras. In addition, people give digital filter effects to the photos. They also purchase or make our own labels to add it. Thanks to the development of smartphones and widely used SNS, everything became possible and easy. Everything began from the human desire to express ourselves. In near future, the technology that helps to express oneself in better way will take part in our lives for certain.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Q1) What will be “the Next Generation” photo editing that we desire?</b></div><div>We already have gone through the revolution of Computer Graphics (CG) in the movies, games, architecture, and so forth. CG brought us the satisfaction of “virtual reality”. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Q2) What makes the CG possible in the movie? And why can’t we achieve it easily?</b></div>
<div>The answer lies within the 3D modeling, image compositing, and rendering technology. These bring the realism into the movie screen. However, It is very difficult for the average users to utilize it, because the 3D modeling isn't easy to learn and intuitive to use. Moreover, Image compositing and rendering tasks are expensive to perform and to operate.</div><div><br></div><div>So, that’s why NEMOART is here for us.</div><div>NEMOART provide the photorealism to your precious photos. You only need to put the 3D model formulated by cubes and make one simple click. Then, everything is fully responsible to NEMOART rendering cloud service.</div>
<div><br></div><div><b>Q3) What kind of 3D cubes can we put into the photos?</b></div><div>You can use 3D cubes made by other users or experts, or you may make one on your own. All the steps are as easy as playing with ‘LEGO’ blocks.</div><div><br></div><div>NEMOART is the first service that provides modeling, compositing, and rendering with one’s smartphone at once. It also has a meaning of next-generation in editing photos.</div><div><br></div><div>NEMOART is the first project of “BARI”. We imagine the virtual reality in the computer environment like Matrix. For such reason, we study and prepare various technologies other than NEMOART.&nbsp;</div><div>We look forward to have your kind attention and contribution to our first service, NEMOART.</div><div><br></div>
<div><b>2. How does it work?</b></div><div>NEMOART can formulate model and scene, and then it can process through Rendering Cloud Service.</div>

<div><br></div><div><b style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Photorealistic effect&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>As above gallery samples have shown, NEMOART’ rendering makes your 3D creation into reality. Using several materials such as glass, plastic, and mirror, your 3D creation seems to be genuine with proper exposure. This is one of the most powerful weapons in NEMOART. NEMOART generates natural light as if your 3D creation is originally in the photo. Therefore, you just put your own 3D creation into photo in order to make a natural image. Your 3D creation is not a simple 2D emoticon anymore. It is reusable and recreative in various dimensions and in different spaces. These works are attributed to the following effects. In other words, it means that your 3D creation can be set in any position, and it can be adjusted to any sizes according to your photo composition. If it is created on your hand, it can be free anywhere.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>• &nbsp;Realistic material&nbsp;</div><div>• &nbsp;Natural light</div><div>• &nbsp;Reflection effect</div><div>• &nbsp;Refraction effect</div><div>• &nbsp;Shadow effect</div><div><br></div>

<div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">  </span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="line-height: 1.5; white-space: pre;">	</span></div><div><b>Material</b></div><div>NEMOART supports several materials, which means that you can assign different materials to different cubes. Even though you make the same figure model, the rendering images depend on the materials which you choose. Your 3D model can be air, glass, metal and so on. It can also be light as well.</div>

<div><b>Natural light</b></div><div>In real life, the same object looks different depends on where it is. If the object is under the hot sun, it seems to be vivid. On the other hand, the object is under the candlelight, it seems to be dim. NEMOART also provides the natural light based on the light source of your photo. Therefore, the same model can be appeared differently depending on the photo that you use.</div>

<div><br></div><div><b>Reflection</b></div><div>If you make a floor based on the reflective materials such as metal or mirror, you can see that another 3D creation of yours can be visualized on the floor with defined reflection. Furthermore, the objects that were originally in your photo also show reflection on the floor as well. This reflection effect makes 3D creation more realistic.&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Refraction</b></div><div>If you are using glass or air material, you can create refracted effects of your 3D creation so that it can show the back side of it.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Shadow</b></div><div>If you use shadow effect in NEMOART, one can finally achieve your 3D creation to perfection. You can make an actual shadow of your 3D creation in your photo. Most people won’t be able to differentiate whether it is real or not.</div>
